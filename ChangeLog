
This Log of changes in my package berryFunctions contains two sections:
1. future development - a list of things I want to change
2. development over time - a log of the changes I already made

1. berryFunctions - future development
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- changeAttribute, showAttribute, partly also shapeZoom:
# include require2(maptools), require2(spatstat) in examples 
# read shapefiles not with maptools functions, but with package rgdal
# enable all shapefile types
# understand id_col
# coltochange with number
# CL-TK GU-Interface allowing to click on another segment, and the info in the interface is updated automatically. http://www.sciviews.org/_rgui/tcltk/
# catch warning message in as.psp.SpatialLinesDataFrame

- createDoc: no . DEFAULT for ones ending with . or ? or !

- exp4p:
# try to improve with  nls(y~expfun(p,x=x), start=as.list(param) )  
# allow specification of initial values for optim

- extremeStatLmom: Include Bootstrapping with user-specified proportion left out

- lsc: # Still need to find out what to do with optim

- mReg: 
# add hyperbolic functions
# quantify / test influence of replacing zeros with near-zero values

- pointZoom: rename Argument colp, as col cannot be given currently.

- shapeZoom: 
# set steps higher and Time lower 
# linear zooming properties

- textField: 
# Bounding boxes are too high
# # Adjust adj parameter based on pos and offset: if(!is.null(pos))# i want the field to still be drawn with adj, but have it based on pos
# check out "Rounded not yet possible with log axes"
# support srt

Version 1.5 (2014-09-03)
To-Do-list centralized and sorted here, no to-Dos left in source code.
- climateGraph: argument lists for each polygon with owa. sum and avg now at figure margins via mtext.
- createDoc: extreme simplification of creation of usage section. Now creates new .Rd file if one already exists. Backslash handling optimized, but not perfect yet. Now allows latex in arg explanation, but the function start has to be indicated by a single { in an otherwise empty line. "fun" argument does not have to be in quotation marks anymore. Equal sign in defaults now handled correctly.
- logVals: Default values for 'from' and 'to' changed
- seqR: range is now first argument, so it doesn't have to be given each time. min and max argument "finite" changed to "na.rm".
- tableColVal: argument lists for each text group, allowing srt etc.
- owa: throws an understandable error when unnamed arguments are in the list
- lsc: now warns when sum under UH is !=1. Calculation time Rcmd check in examples reduced. nse and rmse explicitly called from this package.
- mReg: exp_4p outsourced, rsquare and rmse taken from package, R^2 is now calculated on the actual fit, not its linearization
- require2 received the alias library2
- colPoints, colPointsLegend: generally rewritten. classification methods, cpHist and smallPlot added.
- extremeStatLmom: code for legend arguments improved (with owa) 
- packages lmom and spatstat were moved from "suggests" to "imports", as they are within functions and not just in the examples.

New functions: normPlot, betaPlot, exp4p, compFiles, funTinn, pretty2, colPointsHist, classify, smallPlot
functions removed: compareDoc (Rcmd check does this better, once a package is set up), extremeStat (replaced with extremeStatLmom)

Version 1.4 (2014-07-01)
Added To-Do list with my personal wishes (and some comments from other people) at the top of this ChangeLog. Examples in several functions received line breaks / shortening
- extremeStatLmom: p.value by ks.test as measure for goodness of fit addded. Output is now data.frame instead of matrix. Value field in Doc is complemented. Examples are updated.
- lsc: example QP-Data is now a file in the package folder extdata, not a dropbox link anymore (files were accidentally deleted and it was too slow anyways). P and Q labels are now placed in the outer margin.
- mReg: ditto for temp data

New function: linLogTrans

Version 1.3 (2014-06-08)
Description field much more verbose
Shapefile (6 MB) removed from data
examples in changeAttribute, showAttribute, shapeZoom changed accordingly


----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.2 (2014-06-06)

email address in DESCRIPTION Maintainer Field (how could I possibly miss that typo?!) is now corrected.
This ChangeLog is now reformated to create a standard layout.
A lot of examples have received line breaks (they were longer than 100 chars).

berryFunctions-package: examples completed and grouped
createDoc: seealso extended.
funnelPLot and mReg: owa removed from function body
lsc: argument returnsim included, output now vector. psi incluced. catchment area included, examples and documentation updated
logVals: description updated
owa: programming example included, description changed.
combineTextfiles: example added.
require2: example is set to dontrun

Version 1.1 (2014-06-05)

First Version to be published
all functions have documentation.
Function names are standardized in lowerCamel.

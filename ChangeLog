
This Log of changes in my package berryFunctions contains two sections:
1. possible future development - a list of things I want to change
2. development over time - a log of the changes I already made

1. berryFunctions - possible future development
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Find all toDos in code + Doc and add to list here
- include require2(maptools), require2(spatstat) in examples of showAttribute, changeAttribute, shapeZoom
- set steps in shapeZoom higher and Time lower
- linear zooming properties for shapeZoom
- extend showAttribute to other shapefiles
- enhance showAttribute with interface, see http://www.sciviews.org/_rgui/tcltk/
- climateGraph: argument lists for each polygon with owa
- catch warning message in as.psp.SpatialLinesDataFrame
- line breaks in monthLabs (cut off in Doc)
- seqR example with length=
- mReg R2 am Ende ausrechnen (nicht auf dem linearisierten)
- extremeStatLmom: Return ks.test result for distributions
- reading shapefiles not with maptools functions, but with package rgdal
- createDoc: warn and wait for user input if file already exists. Find out why it didn't work correctly for linLogTrans.
- logVals: Range doesn't work with vector of length>2
- lsc: Find data source back in Hydro folder AB

2. berryFunctions - development over time

Version 1.4 (2014-07-01)
Added To-Do list with my personal wishes (and some comments from other people) at the top of this ChangeLog. Examples in several functions received line breaks / shortening
extremeStatLmom: p.value by ks.test as measure for goodness of fit addded. Output is now data.frame instead of matrix. Value field in Doc is complemented. Examples are updated.
lsc: example QP-Data is now a file in the package folder extdata, not a dropbox link anymore (files were accidentally deleted and it was too slow anyways). P and Q labels are now placed in the outer margin.
mReg: ditto for temp data
Function added: linLogTrans

Version 1.3 (2014-06-08)
Description field much more verbose
Shapefile (6 MB) removed from data
examples in changeAttribute, showAttribute, shapeZoom changed accordingly

Version 1.2 (2014-06-06)

email address in DESCRIPTION Maintainer Field (how could I possibly miss that typo?!) is now corrected.
This ChangeLog is now reformated to create a standard layout.
A lot of examples have received line breaks (they were longer than 100 chars).

berryFunctions-package: examples completed and grouped
createDoc: seealso extended.
funnelPLot and mReg: owa removed from function body
lsc: argument returnsim included, output now vector. psi incluced. catchment area included, examples and documentation updated
logVals: description updated
owa: programming example included, description changed.
combineTextfiles: example added.
require2: example is set to dontrun

double lines
to test dupes

this is a file
with spaces in this line
 with spaces in this line
   with spaces in this line     
with spaces in this line too, but only exact matches are analysed
to test dupes
which is

a function in my misc package berryFunctions
to find duplicate lines in a text file
and color them accordingly
in excel or libreOffice   
using conditional formatting

\title{Create Documentation file from r-source}
\usage{
createDoc(fun, path = "S:/Dropbox/Public/berryFunctions")
}
\arguments{
\item{fun}{Character string or unquoted name. Function (== filename) with structure described in 'Details' in source code.}

\item{path}{Path to package in development containing folders 'R' and 'man'. DEFAULT: "S:/Dropbox/Public/berryFunctions"}
}
\value{
None. Cats documentation for \code{fun} in \code{path}/man. Only usage, arguments and author section are filled, the rest is empty (but the frame is there).
}
\description{
Create Documentation file (especially section arguments) from r-source
}
\details{
This assumes the following structure of source code:\cr 
   \code{MyFun <- function(}\cr 
   \code{arg1, # Explanation of this item}\cr 
   \code{arg2=TRUE, # Ditto, with default}\cr 
   \code{arg3)}\cr 
   \code{'{'}\cr
   \code{computations'}'}\cr
   The opening bracket line may ONLY contain the curly brace
}
\note{
This might be deprecated in favor of Roxygen
}
\section{Warning}{
 This is highly specific to my way of working, don't rely blindly on it.\cr 
    If a file already exists, it is not overwritten, instead a new file \code{fun_2.Rd} or \code{fun_3.Rd} (up to 99), is created.\cr 
    Empty (or space-only) lines are silently ignored.\cr A line with two arguments will throw a warning, 
    as they can't be listed in the argument section. They should be written normally into the usage section.

\description{
Collection of functions, mainly connected with graphics and hydrology.\cr 
- zoom in X11 graphics\cr 
- plot rainfall-runoff data and optimize parameters for the unit hydrograph in the linear storage cascade\cr 
- write text to plots on top of colored fields in label size (halo-effect)\cr 
- draw scatterplots colored by 3rd dimension (as in image, which only deals with grids)\cr 
- draw histograms horizontally\cr 
- advancedly label date axes and logarithmic axes\cr 
- fit multiple functions (power, reciprocal, exponential, logarithmic, polynomial, rational) by regression\cr 
- convert lists to data.frames\cr
- and more...

At some places you'll find \code{## not run} in the examples. These code
blocks were excluded from checking while building, mainly because they are
interactive and need mouseclicks, or because they open another device/file.
Normally, you should be able to run them in an interactive session. If you
do find unexecutable code, please tell me!\cr 
Feel free to suggest packages in which these functions would fit well.\cr 
I strongly depend on - and therefore welcome - any feedback!\cr\cr 
The following functions have been deprecated:\cr 
changeAttribute, showAttribute, shapeZoom: moved to \url{https://github.com/brry/shapeInteractive}\cr 
extremeStat, extremeStatLmom: moved to distLextreme in \url{https://github.com/brry/extremeStat}\cr 
compFiles has been renamed to \code{\link{compareFiles}}. combineTextfiles has been renamed to \code{\link{combineFiles}}.

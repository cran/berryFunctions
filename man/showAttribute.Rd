\title{Show attribute of ESRI-Shapefile line segment selected by mouseclick}
\description{Click near a line segment of a shapefile, and it's attribute(s) are displayed in the console. 
Currently only works for objects of class SpatialLinesDataFrame.}
\usage{showAttribute(object, object_psp=as.psp(object),
coltoshow=1:ncol(object), ID_col=1, notify=TRUE)}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{object of class SpatialLinesDataFrame. Not tested for other objects yet!}
  \item{object_psp}{convert SpatialLinesDataFrame to line segment pattern. slow conversion, rather define it outside the function, especially when using the function more than once. DEFAULT: as.psp(object)}
  \item{coltoshow}{character vector. column(s) of attribute table to be showed. Should technically work with number(s) as well, not tested yet. DEFAULT: 1:ncol(object)}
  \item{ID_col}{Column to be used for identification. Not fully understood yet... DEFAULT: 1}
  \item{notify}{logical. Are you to be told what to do in the console?. DEFAULT: TRUE}
}
\value{none returned. \code{\link{print}}s attrributes of selected item.}
\section{Background}{
My colleague argues that arcGIS is better than R, because you can click on a line segment and see it's attributes.
I took on the challenge to prove that R can do this just as well...}
\note{I have never used Line-Shapefiles in R before, so I doubt this is highly transferable.
Any Feedback is welcome!\cr
The blue "selection" is overdrawn in \emph{white} when par("bg") == "transparent" (the default)\cr
I have some vague ideas about adding some kind of TCL-TK GU-Interface and allowing to click on another segment, and the info in the interface is updated automatically.
But I don't really know yet how to get that done...

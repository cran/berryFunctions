\usage{
learnVocab(vocfile = "C:/Dropbox/Sonstiges/Vokabeln.csv", minhours = 3,
  nnew = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{vocfile}{File with vocabulary (or whatever you want to learn).
The first two lines must contain the learning day and date, see examples.
The third line must contain LEVEL;known;new, the last two being
(short) names, e.g. languages (known will be displayed first).}

\item{minhours}{Minumal number of hours since the last test. If the time 
difference is less, nothing happens. This enables putting learnVocab
in \code{\link{Rprofile}} without being asked stuff all the time
at every restart of R.
DEFAULT: 3 hours}

\item{nnew}{Number of new entries to be added interactively at the start.
They can still be skipped by writing nothing and pressing the ENTER key.
DEFAULT: 3}
}
\value{
Updated vocab list, invisibly.

\description{
spaced learning e.g. for vocabulary. Uses interactive questions.\cr
Note: this currently clears the console!\cr
Based on \url{https://ncase.me/remember} by Nicky Case.\cr
At the beginning, new vocab will be asked, skip with empty ENTER.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{ # Excluded from checks, works only interactively! 
# initiate empty vocab list:
vocfile <- tempfile("myvocab",fileext=".csv")
cat("learning_day 1\\n2019-04-19 17:43:47\\nLEVEL;DE;FR\\n", file=vocfile)

learnVocab(vocfile) # asks new vocab, then tests and changes level as needed
